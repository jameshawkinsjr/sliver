## Background and Overview

#### **Motivation for project:**
   * Learn how to use Canvas and some basic game mechanics
#### **Description:**
   * A top-down game with a sprite that's in a darkened room. They can only see a sliver of light ahead of them and have to traverse through a map to get to the next room. All the while, enemies are randomly walking around as well. Encountering an enemy hurts you.
